        Created an instance of menu and called the header() method.

    This is the class where we will have the main method which will create an instance of Menu.
    We will then call the header method, prompting the user to input a query starting the search.
    Once the search finishes and the records are retrieved, they will be printed to the console.

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Menu m = new Menu();
        m.header();

    }
